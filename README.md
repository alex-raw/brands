## Term paper livestreams

This is a little project mostly used for demonstrational purpose with focus on academic writing (linguistics) and corpus linguistics. The project is created live together with students.

### How it was made

- written in R-markdown
- compiled with knitR
- Programs used live:
  * editor: neovim (for configuration, see [dofiles](https://github.com/alex-raw/dotfiles/tree/master/.config/nvim))
  * citation manager: bibtex

I might add the same example paper written in Latex and/or pandoc markdown.
