# Introduction

Brands for online services and brands for fashion differ in their metaphorical patterns.

# Concepts

Personification is not one phenomenon, but multiple metaphorical patterns. [@lakoff+johnson08]

Personification is often achieved by means of verbs like *talk*, *say*, *tell*.

Utterance verbs
Announce, utter, mention, remark, note

Online services:
Facebook, Amazon, Google, ebay,
Skype,

# Data collection

## Categorizing brand names

<!-- [pos = "NP(1|2)?.*" & pos != "NPD.*" & pos !="NPM.*"] -->

Code every token tagged as proper noun that occurs more than 10 times as either online service or fashion brand.

Potential problems
Ambiguous nouns: Most fashion brands are also regular names.

Idea: Does the fact that the brand has a regular name have an effect?
