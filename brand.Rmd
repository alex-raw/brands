# Introduction

Brands for online services and brands for fashion differ in their metaphorical patterns.

# Concepts

Personification is not one phenomenon, but multiple metaphorical patterns. [@lakoff+johnson08]

Personification is often achieved by means of verbs like *talk*, *say*, *tell*.

Animacy, animate nouns

Utterance verbs
Announce, utter, mention, remark, note

Online services:
Facebook, Amazon, Google, ebay,
Skype,

# Data collection

The data is drawn from the spoken part of the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA, @coca). It ranges from 1990 to 2012, therefore, the most recent brands cannot be investigated. This is especially true of social media brands, such as TikTok.

The general perception of social media brands can be expected to have changed from a generally positive to a negative one.
It is unclear, however, whether this would cause a change in the main metaphorical patterns.
<!-- TODO: check for individual brands across time? -->
hypothesize whether the old data makes a difference?

## Categorizing brand names

<!-- H&(amp;)?M -->
<!-- [pos != "np.*"] -->
<!-- define $fashion = "Vuitton H&(amp;)?M Nike Zara Gucci Hermes Cartier Adidas Prada"; -->
<!-- define $tech = "Facebook Google Amazon Microsoft Ebay eBay EBay Youtube YouTube Skype Wikipedia Neflix PayPal paypal Paypal Instagram Yahoo" -->

gather data from the top 10 brands for fashion [^fashion] and social media.

Potential problems
Ambiguous nouns: Most fashion brands are also regular names.

Idea: Does the fact that the brand has a regular name have an effect?
